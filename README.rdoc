This is a ruby gem that provides access to the API of {BigBlueButton}[http://bigbluebutton.org].
See the documentation of the API {here}[http://code.google.com/p/bigbluebutton/wiki/API].

It enables a ruby application to interact with BigBlueButton by calling ruby methods instead of
HTTP requests, making it a lot easier to interact with BigBlueButton. It also formats the responses
to a ruby-friendly format and includes helper classes to deal with more complicated API calls, such
as the pre-upload of slides.

A few features it has:

* Provides methods to perform all API calls and get the responses;
* Converts the XML responses to ruby hashes, that are easier to work with;
* Converts the string values returned to native ruby types. For instance:
  * Dates are converted DateTime objects (e.g. "Thu Sep 01 17:51:42 UTC 2011");
  * Response codes are converted to boolean (e.g. "SUCCESS" becomes <tt>true</tt>);
* Deals with errors (e.g. timeouts) throwing <tt>BigBlueButtonException</tt> exceptions;
* Support to multiple BigBlueButton API versions (see below).
